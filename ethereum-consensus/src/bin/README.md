# `gen-spec`

Generates Rust source of future forks of the consensus spec based on prior forks.

Ping @ralexstokes if you need help here, this works but it is quite bespoke code and could be refined so it is easier to maintain and extend.

# `gen-tests`

Generates `rustc` tests that correspond to each test case in the `consensus-spec-tests`.
